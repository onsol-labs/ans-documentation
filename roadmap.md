# Roadmap

Relaunching Our Token:  Over the past six months, AllDomains has experienced substantial growth. Despite the challenging bear market, our dedicated team has focused on developing diverse and innovative technologies for domains. As we entered 2024, buoyed by a resurgence of positive vibes and an upswing in domain sales, we expanded our dev and marketing teams. With significant partnerships on the horizon, it becomes imperative to sustain our momentum.



The introduction of a new token serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it allows us to raise capital essential for fueling our continued growth and fulfilling commitments associated with these strategic partnerships. Additionally, the new token brings an opportunity to implement fresh tokenomics, facilitate several token utility upgrades, align our evolving vision and ensure a robust framework for the future.



The decision to introduce a new token stems from the upcoming launch of innovative features within AllDomains, enabling users to earn while participating across a multitude of domain primitives.&#x20;



**New token, new opportunities:** This relaunch empowers us to create new opportunities for the token with increased creativity and flexibility in token utilization. AllDomains is already pushing Web3 domains forward, innovating what they are and how they work. It is time that our new token evolves into something that aligns with our desire to push them even further, utilizing the potential that is Only Possible On Solana.

Also on the table **for consideration** is the migration of this new token to **token extensions** (formerly known as “Token 2022”) at some point in the near future. Find out more about the new token extensions here [https://solana.com/solutions/token-extensions](https://solana.com/solutions/token-extensions)



**Abundance of New Features:** We are excited to introduce TLD yield, emoji TLDs, Web2 domain tokenization, community/protocol token incentives in certain TLD pools, a new layer to domain functionality in web3, and hosting services. These features will be gradually rolled out in the coming months. Stay tuned for updates in our Discord channel for further updates.&#x20;
