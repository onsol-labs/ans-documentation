# Roadmap

## AllDomains Roadmap 2025–2026: From Identity to Ecosystem

For the past three years, AllDomains has shipped consistently, through bear and bull markets alike. We started with domains and built trust by delivering integrations, products, and partnerships. Today, over 100 projects, from wallets and explorers to communities and TLD partners, all use our infrastructure.

But domains were just the beginning. With over 1.5 million registrations across Solana, Eclipse, Sonic, Monad testnet, AllDomains has a proven track record. Our breakthrough .id domains — the first to work seamlessly across both Web2 and Web3, demonstrated that the future of identity is hybrid.&#x20;

Now comes the next phase. With the launch of $ADNS, we are moving from a single product to a living ecosystem powered by InfoFi intelligence, a cross-chain social graph with seamless value transfers, and the unstoppable momentum of community-driven growth.&#x20;

This roadmap is the blueprint for how domain names evolve, how identity becomes infrastructure, and how ownership turns into an economy.

The endgame is clear: AllDomains is moving past domain name service to become the identity network and economic layer of Web3 - open, composable, and powered by community ownership.

### Perfect Timing, Powerful Momentum

The stars are aligning for AllDomains. Seeker SZN is live right now, with .skr domains powered by our infrastructure driving massive adoption. AllDomains Experience Season 2 will bring additional incentives for Seeker users, creating a direct bridge between mobile crypto adoption and our ecosystem. Meanwhile, Monad mainnet approaches in Q3-Q4, where we're already positioned with over 940,000 domains registered on testnet and getting ready for the mainnet launch.

With Eclipse and Seeker onboarding, domains are becoming an important part of Web3 infrastructure. This isn’t just good timing. It’s strategic positioning, placing AllDomains at the intersection of mobile crypto, new chain launches, and the rise of identity as core infrastructure.

### From Identity → Full Ecosystem

Owning your name was just the beginning. The real mission is bigger: building the most powerful cross-chain identity protocol in crypto, not just a name service, but the infrastructure layer for Web3 identity, and expanding that identity into an ecosystem of products.

Not every product will require a domain, but every product will connect back into the same identity system, with $ADNS at the core and making everything more intuitive, efficient, and powerful:

* Domains will anchor identity turning names into the foundation of ownership and access.
* Tokenizing 300M+ Web2 domains unlocking a $300B+ real-world asset class inside a unified marketplace that bridges Web2 and Web3.
* Bridges and swaps will move value seamlessly scaling chain by chain, asset by asset.
* InfoFi products will surface intelligence delivering insights and unlocking new earning opportunities through data-driven tools.
* SocialFi tools will connect people and projects transforming on-chain identity into reputation, community, and collaboration.
* Privacy layers will secure ownership and communication enabling private domains and encrypted messaging between users.
* Open Graph Protocol will unify profiles bringing assets, activity, and reputation together across chains.
* Leveraging AI-powered tools will enhance every interaction  optimizing user experience and protocol efficiency at scale.

This is how domains evolve from basic aliases into intelligent, functional, financial, and social assets; the glue that makes Web3 durable.

### Ignition (Q3 2025): $ADNS goes live, utility from day one

The story begins with the $ADNS Token Generation Event (TGE).

This isn't just a launch, it's ignition. $ADNS goes live with real utility from day one: trading incentives, rewards linked to protocol activity, and upcoming Season 2 of the AllDomains Experience with special benefits for Seeker users to new participants and long-term community members.&#x20;

For the first time, users' engagement and activity across domains will directly connect back to the token, enhanced by recommendations and personalized experiences.

Crucially, 50% of protocol revenues, from registrations, renewals, and fees, will now flow back into the token. Future products will also allocate a share, creating a compounding effect as the ecosystem expands.

It's a clean, on-chain launch that sets the tone: transparent, community-driven, and aligned with growth.

### Expansion (Q4 2025): From domains to infrastructure

After ignition, the roadmap expands. Q4 is about scaling utility and proving that AllDomains is more than domains.

The quarter opens with our strategic validator partnership alongside DeFiDev Corp, co-launching a validator that gives the community a direct way to stake into AllDomains growth while also securing the network.&#x20;

Our existing bridge evolves into Bridge 2.0, expanding from today’s limited routes into a flagship product that scales chain by chain and asset by asset. Together with advanced swaps, it enables seamless asset movement across chains and ecosystems.

With Monad mainnet expected, we're positioned to be day-one ready with our massive testnet adoption. Meanwhile, our swaps evolution becomes more than just a feature; it’s a comprehensive liquidity layer across Solana and beyond, enabling cross-chain value transfer and friction-less user experiences.

The InfoFi tools reveal another major milestone. Already powering private launchpads in beta, these data-driven platforms unlock new earning opportunities through on-chain insights and analytics enhanced by machine learning.&#x20;

Culture meets technology with emoji TLDs and subdomains, new namespaces that expand identity into expression and drive viral adoption. The quarter culminates with a fundamental shift toward decentralization, beginning with open-sourcing core components of the AllDomains protocol. Domain resolution, TLD management, and modular SDKs for wallet and dApp integration become publicly available, inviting the broader developer community to build, contribute, and innovate on our infrastructure.

The Builder Rewards Program launches alongside, offering grants, bounties, and revenue sharing for developers who contribute to the open protocol. This creates a flywheel effect: more developers, better products, stronger ecosystem, higher token utility.

Q4 turns AllDomains from a single product into a multi-product ecosystem with infrastructure support and community ownership.

### Unification (Q1 2026): Web2 meets Web3 identity

Identity isn't just Web3-native. Building on our proven .id success, we'll expand Web2 tokenization to .com, .net, and .org and others, linking them directly to wallets and on-chain profiles. This creates an enterprise adoption pathway for traditional companies looking to tokenize their existing domains and bridge into Web3 ownership. Imagine using the same name for your website, your payments, and your decentralized identity.\
\
For the first time, enterprises and individuals can unify their Web2 domains with Web3 identity payments, profiles, and ownership tied together.

This phase also introduces the Open Graph Protocol: identity-based profiles connecting across chains to offer bespoke and uninterrupted experiences. Social features, reputation systems, and governance tools will tie communities and projects closer together, while intelligent algorithms surface relevant connections and opportunities.

The decentralization movement accelerates with DAO rollout for community-led governance of namespaces, rewards, and protocol evolution. $ADNS holders won't just hold tokens, they'll shape the protocol's future, create new TLDs using $ADNS, and unlock new utility across the open ecosystem. This is where the protocol becomes truly community-owned, with the Builder Rewards Program driving continuous innovation, guided by key figures from across the Solana ecosystem serving as advisors and council members.

Probably one of our most exciting products of 2025 will be privacy-first domains, powered by zero-knowledge technology. Privacy-first domains let users transact and connect using domains without exposing their wallets, essential for both individuals and enterprises.

### Q2 2026 — The Identity Network & Economic Layer

By mid-2026, the roadmap completes its arc. Domains, bridges, swaps, validators, marketplaces, privacy layers, and social extensions will all interconnect into one unified system. The open protocol thrives with contributions from developers worldwide, while the Builder Rewards Program and AI-assisted development tools fuel continuous innovation. Projects will launch TLDs permissionlessly using $ADNS and the community will govern protocol evolution through decentralized governance.

Private domains expand with encrypted messaging between domain holders, creating secure communication channels without revealing underlying wallet addresses.

At this stage, AllDomains is no longer "a name service." It's the Identity Network and Economic Layer, the community-owned infrastructure that powers how people, projects, and value move through Web3.

### Endgame: The Identity Network

The world has already seen billion-dollar domain protocols. Now imagine that multiplied by de-fi, InfoFi, social, privacy, and Web2 onboarding, that’s the scale we’re building toward. AllDomains shows what comes after domains. Identity tied to liquidity and data. AI-enhanced user experiences. Social graph tied to governance. Web2 seamlessly integrated with Web3. Private domain ownership with encrypted communication. An entire economic layer built on who you are, enhanced by intelligence that makes everything work better.

That's why we built $ADNS differently: community-first, with real distribution, transparent liquidity, AI-powered efficiency, and revenue flowing back into the token.

This isn't about hype. It's about building the intelligent rails of Web3 identity and the economic infrastructure of tomorrow. And we're just getting started!
