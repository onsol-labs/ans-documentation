# Getting a TLD

As stated before, **AllDomains** opens up **Top-Level Domain** (TLD) creation so that any project, community, or user can distribute its own ._**\[anything]**_ domains, providing users with the freedom of choice for their Web3 ID.

Our **Get Your TLD** feature enables just that, by allowing you to claim your TLD, set up your own revenue plan, prices, NFTs background, etc.

The choice for your _**.\[anything]**_ is yours! Of course, as with any other Web3 asset, some may be more valuable than others! Pay attention to your communities’ needs, rituals, and slogans, and choose the TLD you think best suits you!

Some communities may decide to go for a more formal TLD (.thug), while others for a more viral one (.caw). The choice is yours, just remember, a TLD can be a valuable tool for your projects’ branding, provide value to its users, and drive up your engagement! aim for something that best represents your product, values, and users!

We can offer you a wide variety of custom claim methods for your TLDs:&#x20;

* Claim via NFT
* Claim via SFT
* Claim in multiple SPLs
* Claim in Token Extensions
* Claim using your own $TOKEN

If you want to start a new TLD please contact us via the form here [https://alldomains.id/launch-tld](https://alldomains.id/launch-tld)
