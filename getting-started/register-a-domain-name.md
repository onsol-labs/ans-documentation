3. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, scroll up and down the TLD list and find your favorite one! \
   Alternatively, if you know exactly what domain name you want, just type in the complete domain in the search bar (e.g. alldomains.maxi) to get that specific result

You can use filters to select certain TLDs to compare prices or check the expiration dates for previously purchased domain names.\

Feel free to play around and discover your best choice!
