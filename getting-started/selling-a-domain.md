# Selling a domain

To sell a domain users need to wrap their domains as NFTs. Domains can be wrapped (as NFTs) or unwrapped to reveal the domain at any time. When a user wraps their domain:

1. The domain is transferred to an escrow account
2. The smart contract creates an NFT that is transferred to the user in return
3. When the NFT is unwrapped, the program will burn the NFT and return the domain to the owner

Users can wrap and unwrap their domain names a limitless number of times Once a domain is wrapped (as an NFT) they can view it in their wallet and trade it on any NFT marketplace.
