# On Eclipse

Following our successful launch of **.turbo TLD**, we have opened the AllDomains Experience for all **Eclipse domain name** owners

To get access to the AllDomains Experience on Eclipse, you will have to either:

**A.** Renew a freely claimed domain name (domains claimed pre-public launch)\
or\
**B.** Publicly claim a .turbo domain (available soon)

After doing either of the steps above, using your dashboard, you will get access to a new string of tasks that can earn you Experience Points:

* Renew domain - repeatable; rewards issued per action&#x20;
* Join our Discord server
* &#x20;Follow us on X&#x20;
* Set up a main domain&#x20;
* Link your X account - completed by default for users that registered pre-public

More tasks are being developed and will be available in the upcoming days
