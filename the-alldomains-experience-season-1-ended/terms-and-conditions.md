# Terms and conditions

Point programmes can be an effective method for AllDomains to acquire new users, reward loyalty, and ultimately get our products into the hands of users who will find value in using them.

Season 1 is designed to both highlight and encourage all the tasks within the AllDomains Dashboard. We believe the more actions taken by a user will result in a more rewarding experience.

The AllDomains Experience S1 (and future campaigns) aims to attract these users, and incentivize them to use the platform and our products.

### Terms and conditions

Through interaction with alldomains.id services, users can earn “AllDomains Experience” Points. AllDomains Experience Points do not hold any inherent value in real currency, do not constitute the personal property of the user, nor are they treated as currency or a medium of exchange. Points are also non-redeemable, non-refundable, and non-convertible into any form of currency or other value.

**We reserve the right to:**

* Remove points/exclude players for fraud
* Change the points value for the available challenges at any time during the campaign's duration. Changes will be made visible on the website

**Please note:**

* Some points are assigned to the domain name, not the wallet (Register a Domain Name task), while others are assigned to the paying wallet (Renew a Domain Name task)
* Challenges should remain completed for the whole duration of the campaign. If at any point an action needed to complete a challenge will be reverted by the user, the points awarded can be removed from the profile&#x20;
  * Ex. activate notifications, points are awarded and after that, the notifications are disabled

We may revise and update these Terms and Conditions for all current and upcoming tasks. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter.
