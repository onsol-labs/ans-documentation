# Overview

### **What is AllDomains?**

**AllDomains** is a Web3 platform to create, register, and trade customizable Web3 Identities for .everyone

With AllDomains any user can choose not only a name they desire but also the community they wish to associate with, adding a new layer of customization to their Web3 identity. Be it a Token, an NFT collection, or a DAO, **everyone can create their own TLD** and unite their whole community under a unique brand. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**AllDomains** opens up **Top Level Domain** (TLD) creation so that any project or community can distribute its own **.\[anything]** domains providing users with the freedom of choice for their Web3 ID.
{% endhint %}

At the same time, AllDomains is the first protocol to **bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3** by enabling Web2 domain name registrations on Solana. To this end, we have launched **pilot domain name** registrations for the **.ID Web2 TLD**. These work for both their initially intended purposes and as Web3 domain names in parallel.
