### What is .com on Solana?

.com on Solana is a hybrid Web2 / Web3 domain system.

It upgrades traditional .com domains with on-chain ownership, identity, and liquidity, while preserving full DNS functionality, ICANN compatibility, and real-world usage.

Your website stays the same. Your email stays the same.

What changes is how ownership, identity, and transferability work.

This is not a new TLD. These are real .com domains, upgraded.
