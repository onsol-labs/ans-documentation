# On-Chain Mechanics

### What is stored on-chain

The on-chain metadata includes:

* Ownership (wallet)
* Unique domain identifier
* Expiry and renewal state
* Metadata pointers (including name server records)

***

### Ownership history

Ownership history is publicly visible on-chain.

***

### Synchronization

Web2 and Web3 records are always synchronized.

It is not possible for ownership or renewal state to become out of sync.
