# Trading & Wrapping

### What is wrapping?

Wrapping prepares a domain for resale on marketplaces.

Wrapped domains:

* Are not actively used on Web2
* Can be listed on supported marketplaces

***

### Why name servers must be removed

Domains with active name servers are considered "in use".

To protect buyers and sellers, in-use domains cannot be wrapped or sold.

This prevents selling live websites.

***

### Selling a domain

To sell a domain:

1. Remove name servers
2. Wrap the domain
3. List it on a supported marketplace<br>

***

### Marketplaces

Trading will be supported on major Solana NFT marketplaces.

Secondary sales incur a 5% royalty.

Standard Solana transaction fees apply and are negligible.
