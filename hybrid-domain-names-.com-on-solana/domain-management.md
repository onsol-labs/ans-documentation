# Domain Management

### Name servers

Name servers are managed from your domain dashboard.

You can:

* Add name servers
* Remove name servers
* Update them at any time

DNS changes propagate almost instantly.

***

### Using your domain

You can use your .com domain exactly like any other Web2 domain:

* Websites
* Hosting providers
* Email services (Google Workspace, Outlook, etc.)

On-chain functionality does not interfere with Web2 usage.

***

### Transfers between wallets

You can transfer a domain to another wallet as long as name servers are empty.

This prevents accidental transfers of actively used domains.

***

### Wallet loss

If you lose access to your wallet, the domain is lost.

There is currently no recovery mechanism.

Users are strongly encouraged to secure wallets and renew domains early.
