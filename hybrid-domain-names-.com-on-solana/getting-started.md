# Getting Started

### Step 1: Connect a wallet

Connect any Solana wallet on the AllDomains website.

The connected wallet becomes the owner wallet for your domain.

***

### Step 2: Register or bring a .com on-chain

You can:

* Register a new .com domain
* Bring an existing .com domain on-chain

Both result in a hybrid domain with Web2 and Web3 functionality.

***

### Step 3: Manage your domain

From your profile you can:

* View owned domains
* Manage name servers
* Renew domains
* Transfer ownership

***

### Step 4: Renewals

Hybrid domains must be renewed through AllDomains.

Each renewal:

* Extends the Web2 registration
* Extends the Web3 ownership

Renewals are unified — it’s not possible to renew only one side.
