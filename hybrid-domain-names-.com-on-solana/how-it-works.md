# How It Works



### Web2 and Web3 roles

.com domains continue to exist in the Web2 world:

* Registered via ICANN-compatible registries
* Resolved via DNS
* Used for websites, email, and hosting

The Web3 layer adds:

* On-chain ownership (wallet-based)
* Transferability
* Programmable identity
* Future marketplace liquidity

Web2 remains the legal root.

The blockchain upgrades ownership and utility — it does not replace domain law or DNS.

### Registration model

AllDomains registers .com domains on your behalf through standard Web2 registries.

Once registered, a corresponding on-chain record is created on Solana that represents:

* Ownership
* Renewal state
* Metadata pointers

This creates a single hybrid domain that works across both worlds.

***

### Ownership model

* AllDomains is the legal Web2 registrant
* You control the domain on-chain via your wallet
* Ownership transfers happen on-chain
* Legal enforcement remains Web2-based

This design ensures compatibility with existing internet rules while enabling Web3 utility.
