# FAQ

1\. How is this different from ENS / Unstoppable / other on-chain domains?

ENS and similar systems create new Web3-only domains.\
AllDomains upgrades Web2 domains giving them Web3 utility as well!

.com on Solana preserves real DNS and ICANN compatibility, while adding on-chain ownership and utility. It’s built for use, not just trading.

***

2\. Is my .com still registered with ICANN?

Yes. AllDomains registers and manages the domain through standard ICANN-compatible registries.

***

3\. Who actually owns the domain — me or the protocol?

AllDomains is the legal Web2 registrant, as we register the domain on your behalf.\
You control the domain’s on-chain ownership, management, and transfer via your wallet.

***

4\. What happens if I don’t bring my .com on-chain?

Nothing changes. Your domain continues working exactly as it does today.

Bringing it on-chain is optional.

***

5\. Can I bring any .com on-chain, or only new ones?

You can bring both existing and newly registered .com domains on-chain.

***

6\. Is this just a wrapper or synthetic representation?

No.

This is not a wrapped or mirrored asset. It’s a hybrid system where the Web2 domain remains real and functional, with a native on-chain ownership and utility layer added.

***

7\. Why hasn’t this been done before?

Because it’s extremely hard.

Most past attempts focused on tokenization for trading. Preserving DNS, ICANN compatibility, renewals, disputes, and real usage at scale requires deep integration with Web2 infrastructure.

***

8\. Why did you choose Solana?

Solana offers the speed, low fees, and composability required for internet-scale identity and naming.

Other chains simply aren’t practical for this use case.

***

9\. Is this permanent, or experimental?

This is production infrastructure built on existing Web2 domain standards.

It’s designed to be long-term, not experimental.

***

10\. Is this just for speculation and trading?

No. Trading comes later.

The primary goal is ownership, identity, and real-world utility. Liquidity is a benefit, not the foundation.

***

11\. What happens if AllDomains shuts down?

Your Web2 domain continues working unchanged.

All on-chain records remain publicly available. You can also renew domains for multiple years in advance to reduce risk.

***

12\. Can this be censored or revoked?

The same rules apply as Web2 today.

Legal actions, UDRP rulings, and court orders are enforced at the registry level. The on-chain layer reflects real-world outcomes.

***

13\. What prevents double ownership (Web2 vs Web3)?

Web2 remains the legal root.

On-chain ownership is linked to and enforced through the Web2 registration, preventing conflicting ownership states.

***

14\. What happens during domain renewal?

Renewals are handled through AllDomains and always renew both Web2 and Web3 together.

It’s not possible to renew one without the other.

***

15\. Can this break or be hacked?

The Web2 domain infrastructure remains unchanged.

The on-chain layer uses standard blockchain security assumptions. There is no additional risk to DNS, websites, or email.

***

16\. Is this compliant with existing domain regulations?

Yes. Domains remain governed by existing ICANN, registry, and registrar rules.

***

17\. What stops someone from front-running or stealing domains?

Ownership changes require both valid Web2 registration and on-chain authorization.

There’s no mechanism to claim or steal a domain without proper control.

***

18\. Is this legally recognized ownership?

Legal ownership remains Web2-based.

The on-chain record provides verifiable ownership and transferability within that legal framework.

***

19\. What happens in disputes?

Disputes are resolved exactly as they are today in Web2.

Registries and registrars remain the final authority.

***

20\. Can I transfer my on-chain .com instantly?

Yes. Transfers between wallets are instant, provided the domain is not actively in use (name servers removed).

***

21\. Are there royalties or fees on transfer?

Yes. A 5% royalty applies to secondary market sales. No other protocol fees apply.

Standard Solana transaction fees are negligible.

***

22\. Will marketplaces support this natively?

Yes. Trading will be supported on Magic Eden and Tensor.

***

23\. When will secondary trading go live?

A few days after launch, in the next rollout phase.

***

24\. Can I use this as collateral or in DeFi?

Not at launch. This may be possible in the future, depending on ecosystem integrations.

***

25\. Is ownership history fully transparent?

Yes. Ownership history is publicly visible on-chain.

***

26\. Are premium domains treated differently?

At the moment premium domain names (<5 chars) are not available worldwide

***

27\. Can registrars block this?

Registrars continue to enforce Web2 rules, but cannot arbitrarily override on-chain ownership without legal basis.

***

28\. Does this reduce escrow risk?

Yes. Transfers settle instantly on-chain without traditional escrow delays.

***

29\. Is liquidity expected to be better than Web2?

Yes. On-chain settlement and global marketplaces significantly reduce friction.

***

30\. How do apps resolve a .com on-chain?

Apps query the on-chain record for ownership and metadata, while DNS continues to resolve via standard Web2 infrastructure.

***

31\. Is there an API or SDK?

APIs and developer tools are planned.

***

32\. How do wallets resolve .com names?

Wallets resolve ownership and metadata via Solana, similar to other name services.

***

33\. Can this be used for payments?

Yes. Domains can function as human-readable payment identifiers.

***

34\. What metadata is stored on-chain?

* Ownership (wallet)
* Domain identifier
* Expiry / renewal state
* Metadata pointers  name servers)

***

35\. Is this composable with other protocols?

Yes. It’s designed as a composable identity primitive.

***

36\. Does this work on mobile?

Yes, including Solana-native mobile wallets and apps.

***

37\. Is this Solana-only?

Solana is the first chain.

***

38\. Can other chains integrate later?

Yes. The system is chain-agnostic by design.

***

39\. Do I need crypto to use this?

Yes! All registrations, domain management, etc. are on-chain, so a moderate amount of $SOL and $USDC are required.

***

40\. Do I need a crypto wallet?

Yes, to manage on-chain ownership. Not required to simply use the domain as a website.

***

41\. Is this safe for businesses?

Yes. It preserves existing legal and operational domain standards.

***

42\. What’s the benefit if I never trade my domain?

You still gain verifiable ownership, identity, and future-proof utility.

***

43\. Is this a new TLD?

No. These are real .com domains.

***

44\. Will my registrar still manage my domain?

AllDomains manages registration on your behalf.

***

45\. What’s the downside?

You’re responsible for wallet security, and renewals include a Web3 component.

***

46\. Isn’t this just marketing hype?

No. It’s a functional upgrade to existing internet infrastructure.

***

47\. Didn’t others try this already and fail?

Others focused on speculation. AllDomains focuses on usability and compatibility.

***

48\. Why hasn’t ICANN done this themselves?

ICANN governs policy, not product innovation.

***

49\. Is this just NFTs rebranded?

No. Domain NFTs don’t preserve DNS, renewals, or legal domain frameworks.

***

50\. Is this another Web3 domain cash grab?

No. Pricing is fixed and comparable to traditional domains.

***

51\. What problem does this really solve?

It makes domain ownership programmable, transferable, and interoperable — without breaking the web.

***

52\. Why now?

Infrastructure, blockchains, and demand have finally matured.

***

53\. Who is this actually for?

Businesses, creators, professionals, developers, and of course regular users.

***

54\. Is this sustainable long-term?

Yes. It’s built on the existing global domain economy.

***

55\. What’s stopping big registrars from copying this?

Execution. Hybrid domains require deep Web2 and Web3 integration.

For Later

***

2\. Does this affect my existing website, email, or DNS setup?

No. Everything continues working exactly as it does today.

Your website, hosting, email, and DNS remain unchanged.\

***

45\. Why should I care if my site already works?

Because ownership, identity, and interoperability are becoming programmable.

This is an upgrade, not a fix.
