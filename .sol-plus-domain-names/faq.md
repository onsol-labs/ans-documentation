#### What is .sol PLUS?

.sol PLUS is an upgraded version of your existing .sol domain. By upgrading your .sol domain with AllDomains, you gain revenue-sharing benefits while retaining your original domain name and unlocking new recurring income opportunities.

***

#### Why upgrade to .sol PLUS domain names?

Upgrading to .sol PLUS transforms your existing .sol domain into a powerful, revenue-generating digital asset. Here’s why upgrading is the smartest move for your domain:

* **Earn Recurring Royalties:** As the upgrader, receive **40% of all future royalties** from sales and renewals — creating ongoing passive income.
* **Maintain Full Ownership:** Your domain name stays exactly the same (.sol), fully compatible with all wallets and dApps.
* **Market Liquidity:** Renewal fees discourage squatting, while abandoned domains return to the market — keeping the ecosystem vibrant.
* **Partnership Benefits:** Share revenue with AllDomains and SNS, strengthening the Solana naming ecosystem.
* **Secure and Transparent:** Royalties and ownership are tracked automatically on-chain for complete transparency.

Upgrade now to unlock these advantages and position yourself as a leader in the future of Solana domain ownership.

#### How does upgrading work?

When you upgrade your .sol domain, you transfer ownership to AllDomains’ smart contract and receive the corresponding .sol PLUS domain — keeping the same domain name and gaining new features.

Upgrading is permanent and irreversible.

***

#### How do renewals work?

* The **upgrader** of a .sol PLUS domain receives **40% of all royalties** from future sales and renewals. The remaining royalties are split between AllDomains (40%) and SNS (20%). Only the original upgrader is entitled to this 40% share, regardless of future owners.

***

#### How does revenue sharing work?

* You receive **40% of all royalties** from future sales and renewals of your .sol PLUS domain.
* AllDomains and SNS share the remaining royalties (40% and 20%, respectively).
* Royalties are automatically tracked and distributed on-chain.

***

#### Can I sell my upgraded .sol PLUS domain?

Yes. When you sell your domain, the new owner takes over renewal responsibilities, but you continue to earn 40% royalties as the upgrader on all future sales and renewals.

***

#### What happens if I don’t renew?

If the domain isn’t renewed within the 50-day grace period, it returns to AllDomains for resale — keeping the domain market active and liquid.

***

#### Will upgrading affect my existing .sol domain’s compatibility?

No. Your domain stays fully compatible with all SNS integrations, wallets, and dApps — just with the added benefits of renewability and royalties.

***

#### Are there any extra fees?

Upgrading and transactions incur only standard, minimal Solana network fees. There are no extra charges by AllDomains.

***

#### Can I revert back to a regular .sol domain?

No. Upgrading to .sol PLUS is a permanent decision and cannot be reversed.
