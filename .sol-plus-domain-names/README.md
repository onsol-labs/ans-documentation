# .sol PLUS domain names

### What is .sol PLUS?

.sol PLUS is an upgraded version of your existing .sol domain on Solana. By upgrading your .sol domain with AllDomains, you transform it into a renewable, revenue-sharing asset — keeping your same .sol domain name but unlocking powerful new benefits like:

* Ongoing royalties from future sales and renewals
* Partnership revenue shared with you, SNS, and AllDomains
* Prevention of domain dormancy and squatting

***

### How Does .sol PLUS Work?

#### Upgrading Your Domain

When you upgrade your .sol domain, you transfer its ownership to AllDomains’ smart contract. In return, you receive full ownership of your .sol PLUS domain — which keeps the exact same domain name as your original (e.g., upgrading 1.sol means you now own 1.sol under the .sol PLUS system).

This process is permanent and irreversible, so upgrading your domain commits you to the .sol PLUS system and its benefits.

***

#### Renewals

* The upgrader of a .sol domain can renew their .sol PLUS domain for free every year, indefinitely, as long as they renew before the expiration date.
* If you sell your .sol PLUS domain, the new owner will be responsible for renewal fees.
* There is a 50-day grace period after expiration to renew your domain before it is returned to AllDomains and made available for resale.

Renewal notifications will be sent via Dialect, Email, and Telegram to keep you informed.\

**Upgrader:** \

**Rest:**\

3 char domains $320/yr\
4 char domains $80/yr\
5+ char domains $10/yr

#### Revenue Sharing Model

Every time a .sol PLUS domain generates revenue through sales or renewals, the proceeds are split as follows:

| **Party**  | **Share of Royalties** |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Upgrader   | 40%                    |
| AllDomains | 40%                    |
| SNS        | 20%                    |

* The upgrader receives 40% of all future royalties, including secondary sales and renewals.
* AllDomains and SNS share the remaining royalties.
* Royalties are tracked and paid out automatically on-chain with every transaction generating revenue.\
  \
  E.G.:

You upgrade 1.sol to the 1.sol PLUS system\
You then sell this domain for 100 $SOL\
You receive: 95 $SOL + 40% Royalties (2 $SOL)\
AllDomains receives: 40% Royalties (2 $SOL)\
SNS receives: 20% Royalties (1 $SOL) \
\
If the new buyer sells the domain again, the royalties generated will once again be split at the same ratio between you, AllDomains and SNS.
