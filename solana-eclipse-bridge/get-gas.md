# Get Gas

As with any blockchain, you will need to pay a small amount of money (gas) in the chain’s native token (in Eclipse’s case, that’s $ETH) to be able to perform any kind of transaction.

If you just bridged your $SOL (or $USDC) and only own these assets in your Eclipse wallet, you must swap a small amount of these into $ETH to be able to use the chain.

#### The Get Gas feature on our website allows you to get gas in four easy steps:

1. Connect your Eclipse Wallet
2. Select the token ($SOL/$USDC) you want to swap for $ETH
3. Select the amount you want to swap ($5/$10/$20)
4. Click Get Gas and approve the transaction

Since Eclipse is an SVM (Solana Virtual Machine), the gas you just loaded should be enough to get you through plenty of transactions.

If you run out of gas at any point, you can return and load more from the Get Gas feature.
