# Using the Bridge

Our Solana - Eclipse bridge works both ways, meaning you can either:\
\
A. Bridge from Solana to Eclipse\
Or\
B. Bridge from Eclipse to Solana

#### To bridge from Solana to Eclipse, follow these steps:

1\. Connect your Solana Wallet

2\. Select the amount of $SOL you want to bridge

3\. In the \*Recipient\* field, add the Eclipse wallet address or domain name you want to receive your $SOL

4\. Click \*Continue\*, check the details, click \*Send to Eclipse\* and approve the transaction.

{% hint style="success" %}
Make  sure you have enough Gas ($SOL) left in your wallet for the transaction to pass.
{% endhint %}

You can only bridge Solana $SOL to Eclipse $SOL using this route. You will need some Eclipse $ETH (Gas) to start transacting. If you lack Gas in your Eclipse wallet, see the following page: [get-gas.md](get-gas.md "mention")

{% hint style="info" %}
The bridging process will take about a minute to complete.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### To bridge from Eclipse to Solana, follow these steps:

1. Connect your Eclipse wallet
2. Select the token you want to bridge: either $SOL or $ETH !If you choose to bridge $ETH this will be automatically swapped to $SOL via Hyperlane
3. In the _Recipient_ field, add the **Solana wallet address or domain name** you want to receive your $SOL
4. Click _Continue_, check the details, click _Send to Solana,_ and approve the transaction.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Be sure you have enough Gas ($ETH) left in your wallet for the transaction to pass.
{% endhint %}
